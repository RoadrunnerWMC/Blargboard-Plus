# Blargboard Plus
Simple, lightweight board software written in PHP and MySQL. Made easy and straightforward to use compared to larger forum softwares and is a continuation of the Blargboard project by StapleButter.

## Installation
You'll need a webserver with PHP 5.3 or newer, and a MySQL database. Put all the files into the directory you want to install the board into and go to /yourboard/install.php to install. Once installed, you can go to the Dashboard page as the administrator and start configuring your board!
